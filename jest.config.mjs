// This is a Jest configuration that tells Jest how to handle JavaScript files during testing, using Babel to transform the code before running the tests.

// transform:
// This key in the Jest configuration specifies how to process files before running tests.
// The transform option is used to apply pre-processing to files. In this case, it's transforming JavaScript files using Babel.

// ^.+\\.js$:
// This is a regular expression (regex) that matches any file with a .js extension.
// The ^ matches the beginning of the filename, the .+ matches one or more characters, and the \\.js$ matches .js at the end of the filename.

// "babel-jest":
// This specifies that any JavaScript files matching the regex should be transformed using babel-jest, which is a package that allows Jest to work with Babel.
// babel-jest acts as a transformer, applying Babel transformations to the JavaScript code before Jest runs the tests. This ensures that any modern JavaScript features that arenâ€™t natively supported in your test environment are properly transpiled.
